Version 1.1
-----------

[X] - Added a HMAC to the encrypted message. The ciphertext + original salt is HMACed using the AES key. When the message is
      decrypted, the HMAC is recomputed and compared to the original. If it doesn't match then the message has been corrupted
	  or tampered with.

[X] - Removed BCrypt from the internal password hash. After peer review it was deemed un-neccesary as a PBKFD (Rfc2898) is used
      with 70,000 iterations to generate the AES key.

[X] - When setting up the AesCryptoServiceProvider, make the cipher mode and padding schemes more apparent. This application uses
      AES set to CBC mode with PKCS7 padding.


Version 1.0
------------

[X] - Setup passwords. These require double entry to confirm. Only password 1 is mandetory.

[X] - Allow the use of an on screen keyboard to guard against key loggers.

[X] - Allow text to be in encrypted usign the current set password.

[X] - Allow text to decrypted using the current set password.

[X] - Implement a 'copy cipher text to clipboard' button.

[X] - Implement a 'paste cipher text to screen' button.

[X] - Implement a 'delete plain text from view' button that removes the plain text from the screen once it has been encrypted.

[X] - Implement basic themes to make it harder for someone to see what is happening over your shoulder.

[X] - Save settings on application exit. This includes the screen size and co-ordinates, plus the window themes.
